##1987 Genetic Algorithms with Sharing for Multimodal Function Optimization
In this paper the method of sharing functions is developed and investigated to allow the formation of stable subpopulations of different strings within a genetic algorithm. (Aimed to deal with multimodal problems)
It gives an insight of genetic drift, where a finite population will converge to one alternative peak (local-global optimal). It might be provoked by schemata overestimations permitting convergence to wrongs peaks.
Claims that a sharing function is nothing more than a way of determining the degradation of an individual's payoff due to a neighbor at some distance as measured in some similarity space.

*Cavicchio (1971) - It was one of the first to induce niche-like and species-like behavior in GA's. Inroduces "preselection" in which an offspring replaces the inferior parent if the offspring's fitness exceeds that of the infertior paren
*De Jong (1975) - Introduces his crowding scheme as a generalized preselection: individual replace existing strings according to their similarity with other string in an overlapping population, i.e. an individual is compared to each string in a randomly drawn subpopulation of crowding factor memebers.
*Booker (1982) - Takes tha sharing idea in a machine learning applciation with genetic-based classfier systems.
*Shaffer (1984) - Tries separate fixes size subpopulations in Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms (VEGA); It has difficulties handling middling nondominated individuals.
*Grosso (1985) - Maintains explicit subpopulation formation and migration operators
*Mauld√≠n (1984) - Maintains diversity in GAs through his uniqueness operator. This operator defines a parameter similar than simulated annealing which determinates the allowed dissimilarity, if not it mutates the offspring until it meet the criterion.
